# Platformer-Third-Person-Controller
A custom third person controller based on the official Unity third person controller starter asset.

The controller is primarily targeted to be used em 3D Platformers, but can be altered and expanded to whatever use you may need.

It includes classic platforms mechanics like jump, double jump, dodge and walk/run. Also includes configurable camera sensibility, Coyote Time and jump buffer to more responsive controls.

All the components are coneccted to a basic ScriptableObject event system that can be easily iterated on.
